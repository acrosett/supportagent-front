                    <ul>
                        <li>Credits have a fixed accounting value (1 credit = 1 USD).</li>
                        <li>For payments in currencies other than USD, daily exchange rates are obtained from ExchangeRate-API (exchangerate-api.com) at the time of purchase.</li>
                        <li>Credits are non-refundable, non-transferable, and expire 24 months after purchase.</li>
                        <li>Base pricing and consumption rates are displayed on the Pricing Page and may vary.</li>
                        <li>If underlying provider costs change (e.g., OpenAI API pricing), we may adjust credit consumption rates with at least 15 days' notice via dashboard or email.</li>
                        <li>Activating the <strong>SMART AI</strong> mode for a customer priority increases credit consumption rates by <strong>2.5√ó</strong> and is required to enable <strong>custom tools</strong> or <strong>staff escalation</strong> features.</li>

                    <h3>5.3 Wallet &amp; Auto-Top-Up</h3>
                    <p>
                      The Service operates on a <strong>prepaid wallet</strong> basis. Credits are deducted in real time as features are used. 
                      The Client may enable an <strong>auto-top-up</strong> option to automatically purchase additional credits when the wallet balance falls below a chosen threshold.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The Client is solely responsible for configuring auto-top-up and its associated <strong>monthly deposit limit</strong>.</li>
                      <li>Top-ups executed within the configured limit are final, non-refundable, and considered Client-authorized.</li>
                      <li>If the Client disables auto-top-up or reaches the monthly limit, the Service may pause or reject new requests until additional funds are manually added.</li>
                      <li>We are not liable for credit consumption caused by End User or automated interactions that occur within the configured wallet and limit settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      In the event of a verifiable system malfunction causing charges to exceed the <strong>explicitly configured monthly deposit limit</strong>, 
                      our sole obligation is to credit the Client‚Äôs account for the amount exceeding that limit. 
                      This credit constitutes the Client‚Äôs exclusive remedy, subject to the aggregate liability cap in Section&nbsp;11.

                    <h2>6bis. Abuse, Overuse &amp; Shared Responsibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Service includes optional anti-abuse controls (e.g., CAPTCHA, rate limits, per-period message caps, spending controls). 
                        These controls are provided on a <strong>best-effort</strong> basis and are not a guarantee against automated traffic, spam, or malicious use by third parties.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6bis.1 Client Responsibility for Traffic</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Client is solely responsible for all interactions with the embedded widget on its properties, including messages generated by End Users, bots, or third parties.</li>
                        <li>The Client must configure available controls appropriate to its risk profile (e.g., enabling monthly deposit limits, gating access behind authentication where feasible, and monitoring usage dashboards).</li>
                        <li>The Client remains responsible for fees and credit consumption incurred within the configured wallet balance and auto-top-up limits.</li>
                        <li>If the Client fails to configure or maintain a monthly limit, the wallet may continue topping up automatically; all such transactions are considered authorized and non-refundable.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6bis.2 No Abuse-Protection Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>
                        While we may provide tools (e.g., CAPTCHA, rate limiting) to mitigate abusive traffic, we do not guarantee prevention of automated or fraudulent interactions. 
                        The Client is responsible for implementing additional measures as needed (e.g., session gating, identity checks, geo/IP rules).
                    </p>

                    <h3>6bis.3 Credits &amp; Overuse</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Credits consumed due to End User or third-party activity are non-refundable, except as provided in Section 11.4 (Service Faults exceeding the configured monthly deposit limit).</li>
                        <li>Chargebacks or disputes relating to consumption within configured limits or absent a monthly cap are a breach of these Terms.</li>

                      If (and only if) the Client has properly configured a monthly deposit limit and the Service fails to enforce it due to a verifiable defect solely attributable to us, 
                      our sole obligation is to credit the Client‚Äôs account for the <em>amount of charges exceeding that monthly deposit limit</em>. 
                      This credit is the exclusive remedy and is subject to the aggregate liability cap in this Section.
